# Ray Tracer Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple ray tracer based on the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" tutorial with custom modifications to meet specific requirements. The implementation demonstrates fundamental ray tracing concepts including multiple material types, scene composition, and camera configuration.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Vector3 Class (`Vec3`)**: Provides 3D vector operations including:
   - Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
   - Dot and cross products
   - Vector length calculations
   - Random vector generation for sampling
   - Unit vector normalization

2. **Ray Class**: Represents a ray with origin and direction, including parameterized point calculation

3. **Material System**: Implements three material types as required:
   - **Lambertian (Diffuse)**: Scatters rays randomly in the hemisphere around the surface normal
   - **Metal**: Reflects rays with optional fuzziness for surface roughness
   - **Dielectric (Glass)**: Handles both reflection and refraction using Schlick's approximation

4. **Sphere Geometry**: Basic sphere primitive with ray-sphere intersection calculations

5. **Camera System**: Configurable camera with adjustable position, look-at point, field of view, and aspect ratio

6. **Rendering Pipeline**: 
   - Anti-aliasing through multiple samples per pixel
   - Recursive ray bouncing with depth limiting
   - Gamma correction for proper color output

## Scene Composition

The custom scene includes:

### Main Objects
- **Ground**: Large gray sphere (radius 1000) representing the ground plane
- **Central Glass Sphere**: Large dielectric sphere (radius 1.0) at origin with refractive index 1.5
- **Left Diffuse Sphere**: Brown Lambertian sphere (radius 1.0) at position (-4, 1, 0)
- **Right Metal Sphere**: Metallic sphere (radius 1.0) at position (4, 1, 0) with no fuzziness

### Additional Detail Objects
- **Red Diffuse Sphere**: Smaller sphere with warm red coloring
- **Fuzzy Metal Sphere**: Metal sphere with surface roughness (fuzz = 0.3)
- **Small Glass Sphere**: Additional dielectric sphere for variety
- **Green Lambertian Sphere**: Small green diffuse sphere
- **Golden Metal Sphere**: Small metallic sphere with gold-like appearance

## Camera Configuration

- **Position**: (13, 2, 3) - Elevated and offset for an interesting perspective
- **Look-at Point**: (0, 0, 0) - Looking toward the center of the scene
- **Up Vector**: (0, 1, 0) - Standard vertical orientation
- **Field of View**: 20 degrees - Moderate telephoto perspective
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 - Widescreen format

## Rendering Settings

- **Image Resolution**: 800x450 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Anti-aliasing**: 100 samples per pixel for smooth edges and soft shadows
- **Ray Depth**: Maximum 50 bounces for realistic light transport
- **Gamma Correction**: Square root gamma correction for proper brightness

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **All Three Material Types**: Each material type is prominently featured in the scene
2. **Realistic Light Transport**: Multiple ray bounces create realistic shadows and reflections
3. **Anti-aliasing**: Smooth edges and gradients through multiple sampling
4. **Custom Perspective**: Camera positioned to showcase all objects effectively
5. **Varied Object Sizes**: Mix of large and small spheres for visual interest

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Compiler Compatibility**: Fixed `std::clamp` compatibility issues for broader compiler support
2. **Floating Point Precision**: Used epsilon values to prevent self-intersection artifacts
3. **Random Number Generation**: Proper seeding and distribution for Monte Carlo sampling
4. **Color Space**: Gamma correction for perceptually correct color output

## Output

The ray tracer generates:
- `image.ppm`: Raw PPM format output from the ray tracer
- `image.png`: Converted PNG format for easier viewing and sharing
- High-quality rendered image showcasing all material types and lighting effects

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Compile the ray tracer
make

# Run rendering
make render

# Convert to PNG (requires ImageMagick)
make convert

# Complete build and render pipeline
